<h1>Wolfgang's Top 3 Films</h1>
<h2>Here are my current favorites. What are yours?</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p><em>While the books (as usual) are better, these films are incredible adaptations and I could watch them over and over again. Truly remarkable!</em></p>
<h3>No Country For Old Men</h3>
<p><em>This is not a movie I can just play in the background (in contrast to LOTR), but I find the movie to be captivating, and the script is incredible (the opening and final monologues are hauntingly good).</em></p>
<h3>Mud</h3>
<p><em>This is an under-the-radar movie I really, really enjoy. The acting and script feel so authentic in this coming of age story and speaks, I think, specially to the heart of a boy.</em></p>
