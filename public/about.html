<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Born in Austria, raised in the United States, I've now been living for the past 2 years in Bordeaux, France with my wife and two young kids. Still perfecting my French and developing my appreciation for wine!</p>

<p>Building my web dev skills right now. Just leaving some text here because I don't yet know what I'll include in my 'About Me' section of my portfolio, but sure I'll be adding to this later on as I know more.</p>

<p>Same here - leaving this here to fill up space!</p>
